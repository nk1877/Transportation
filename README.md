Using Public transportation data for analysis

Sensor r file uses data from PARAMICS simulation. Detector 3 and Detector 4 are data collected by two sensors. Each 
detector consisted of 144 files. Each file has car passing through sensor every 5 minutes.
flow, density and occupancy plots are plotted in this code

Second file simulates General Motors car following model with I-101 highway data betweet 7:50 and 0805am.

3rd file plots time space diagram for all the cars in I-101 highway between 0805am-0820am. Also detects the shockwave generated
by the vehicles.
